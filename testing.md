\#\#\#\# Run Tests

\* Change directory into the root of the repository i.e \`string-class\` and run the command \`npm install\`. This will install all the dependencies needed for the project to run.

Run the command \`npm test\`. This will run the tests and generate an istanbul test coverage report which can also be accessed through the path \`coverage\/lcov-report\/index.html\`.
