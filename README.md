# Dochero

Dochero is a lightweight RESTful API built in the Javascript language that serves as the backbone for a document management system.

Dochero allows and restricts access to documents stored using a permissions, role based and access sharing framework.

Dochero has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors.
